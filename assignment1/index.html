            I am a hard working and adaptable team player, with experience gained working in a fast-paced, customer focused
            environment as well as in a global automotive manufacturer on various projects. Able to utilise strong organisational
            skills to achieve deadlines and also able to adapt to new situations. Proficient in providing assistance to internal
            and external clients. Eager to expand current knowledge and experience in IT. Proficient in a variety of Microsoft
            products such as Word, Excel, Access and PowerPoint. A good understanding of Windows server 8, active directory and
            VOIP. Provides excellent customer service to customer queries and is able to turn complex technical jargon into a
            simple means that people are able to understand. Furthermore has a great ability to work in high pressure environments
            where tight deadlines need to be met to ensure success.

            In addition to this I am a student at Solent university southampton studying a course in business ingormation
            management. Through thius course I am hoping to progress my career into the field that i am passionate about. The
            reason for choosing this particular course is to give me a great understanding about how IT can be integrated into a
            business environment. taking this instead of something very specific within IT also gives me options when I graduate to 
            choose which path I would like to take with my career
