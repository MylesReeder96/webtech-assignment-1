# 1.Introduction

>The overall goal of the assignment is to be able to produce a fully functional website or application that is resposive and 
is able to publicise and solve a current real-world problem. The resulting website should then be able show a range of functionality
and ability to use vary web application software including HTML5, CSS and Javascript. 

# 2. Specification

## 2.1. Wireframes
>the wireframes that I have created for the desktop and mobile versions do share common aspects in the header and footer sections as
when you are navigating the webpages you need to have a navigation system that avoid causing confusion for the user. in contrasat to
this the main sections of the webpage all contain different uses of formatting via css to give the webpage a fresh feel and 
crates a system that is familiar yet different to the user. the main focus is to keep the webpage simple and effective and avoid
making the page cluttered.

## 2.2. Project colours
>In the case of the colour scheme that has been chosen for the website it is important when creating a bio type page to keep it
simple and in regardds to this having a colour scheme that fits with what the webpage is trying to deliver. there for the main
colours that i have chosen for the website are #286bd6 which is the darker blue and #E4E4E as the main background colour. The use
of these reasonably enables of the features of the website to stand out. additionally the use of as few colours as possibly reduces
the risk of clashing colours which could make certain parts of thge website difficult to read or in some cases unreadable.
