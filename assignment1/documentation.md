# 1.Introduction

> The overall goal of the assignment is to be able to produce a fully functional website or application that is resposive and 
is able to publicise and solve a current real-world problem. The resulting website should then be able show a range of functionality
and ability to use vary web application software including HTML5, CSS and Javascript. the website also needs to be made in a 
way that is going to be usable for users and follow government guidelines.

# 2. Specification

## 2.1. Wireframes
> the wireframes that I have created for the desktop and mobile versions do share common aspects in the header and footer sections as
when you are navigating the webpages you need to have a navigation system that avoid causing confusion for the user. in contrasat to
this the main sections of the webpage all contain different uses of formatting via css to give the webpage a fresh feel and 
crates a system that is familiar yet different to the user. the main focus is to keep the webpage simple and effective and avoid
making the page cluttered.

> As you can see from the above images they are the wireframes for the desktop versions of the website. I have used a reasonably
simple layout for all of the wireframes just to avoid issues with things cluttering up the page.

## 2.2. Project colours
> In the case of the colour scheme that has been chosen for the website it is important when creating a bio type page to keep it
simple and in regardds to this having a colour scheme that fits with what the webpage is trying to deliver. there for the main
colours that i have chosen for the website are '#286bd6' which is the darker blue and '#E4E4E' as the main background colour. The
use of these reasonably enables of the features of the website to stand out. additionally the use of as few colours as possibly
reduces the risk of clashing colours which could make certain parts of thge website difficult to read or in some cases unreadable. 

> headers and footers:
As can be observed the headers and footers of all of the different pages are identical the reason being for this again being
simplicity. The last thing a user wants to see when they go onto a website they are not entirely familiar with is all of the 
navigation bars changing positions every time that they go to another page as it just make it confusing

> main sections:
They main sections of each page as you can assume contain the majority of the features of each of the pages. these are the areas
that have all of the different information for what each of the page is named after and has been thought out to make it possible to
easily access all of the information.

## 2.3. Accessability
> In terms of accessability for those that struggle with seeing the is often a built in function within most browsers that allows
for text-to-speak on webpages. an example of this would be chrome addons. they allow the user to add them to their personal chrome
documents amd then when a page is opened it will read it to the user.

# 4.Evaluation
> To what extent did you tackle the problem that you set out to solve?
I believe i have addressed the initial issue that i set out out to resolve which was to create a portfolio type page of me as a 
person. in addition to this i have ussed validation for the forms to allow people to contact me if they are interested in
contacting me for a job for example.

> What problems did you encounter along the way?
One of the main issues in the creation of the webpage was that the CSS links kept breaking when i was testing the webpage. i had to 
change its format a number of times during the process of making the website.

> How did you test your website/web-application on multiple devices, and what did you find out?

> What informed your design choices?
one of the biggest inflences for my design choices was looking at other proffessional business websites and blogs for people and as
a result the end design
